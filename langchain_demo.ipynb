This technique utilizes more test-time computation and helps the model understand the thinking process behind solving the task.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Providing task-specific instructions or prompts can guide the model in decomposing the task. For example, for writing a novel, the instruction \"Write a story outline\" can help break down the task into subgoals and steps.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Task decomposition can also be done with the help of human inputs. Humans can provide guidance, expertise, or domain knowledge to assist in breaking down the task into manageable subtasks or steps.'\n"
